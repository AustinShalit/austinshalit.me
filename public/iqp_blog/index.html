							<h2>Pre Departure</h2>
							<h6><i>January 2nd, 2019</i></h6>
							<p>The day has finally arrived for me to leave home and go to Israel to study. I spent my day finishing packing up some last minute supplies and clothing. This is also a special time because I will not be able to celebrate my 21st birthday at home with family and friends. We decide to go out to lunch at The Sherman. After finishing lunch, my family and I returned home to grab my suitcases and prepare to leave for LAX.</p>
							<p>This is the last time my family will be whole for almost six months. We have a family meeting and hug and say our goodbyes. At 3pm I start to get into the car. We leave for the airport at 3pm, even though my flight does not leave until 6pm because of the traffic that holiday travelers make. Once at the curb, I give my parents one final hug and prepare to board the plane to SFO.</p>

							<h2>Travel</h2>
							<h6><i>January 2nd & 3rd, 2019</i></h6>
							<p>The plane ride (UA481) to SFO was short and sweet. We were in the air for only 52 minutes. On landing I was able to see the Golden Gate bridge. On arrival in San Francisco, I made my way to the international terminal. I entered the secondary screening area for the flight to Israel and watched the new year's episode of Doctor Who. It was nice to see the Daleks making into the series.</p>
							<p>Once on the plane to Israel (UA954) I met my seat mate. She was traveling to Israel on business and we talked about some of the different places in Israel to go see. The Dreamliner is amazing. The huge windows really do make the flying experience much better because you do not feel as cramped. They also help because the flight attendants lock the windows to be closed when it is bright outside, helping people sleep. My favorite part is that people cannot close their windows giving me an unobstructed view of the landscape. We took an aggressively polar route to Israel, over the west coast of the US and then over Canada, Greenland, Sweden, Poland, and Turkey. We were in the air for 13 hours, 3 minutes and in that time I was able to watch the original Superman, BlacKkKlansman, and Crazy Rich Asians. All of the movies were good but BlacKkKlansman was my favorite. After landing, I found a cab and got to the hotel and went straight to bed after a long day of travel.</p>

							<h2>Arrival</h2>
							<h6><i>January 4th, 2019</i></h6>
							<p>I woke up really early just as the sun was coming out.  I am a bit tired but overall feel excited for the day.  I decide to get up and go for a walk along the beach front.  It is calm with the city still getting started with the day.  I get a bagel and lox from an Aroma with a beach front view.</p>
							<p>My advisor, Isa, calls just as I am finishing breakfast.  She asks me if I can run to the market to purchase fruits and pastries to snack on for the group while walking around tomorrow.  Of course, I agree and make my way over to the market.  The market is massive.  There must have been hundreds of shops and thousands of people there buying fresh fruits and vegetables, clothing, jewelry, and nick-nacks.  I buy what I can carry back to the hotel.  I would do this trip three more times to get enough food for the group.  It was nice to have something to do during the day.</p>
							<p>Once almost everyone arrives we go out for dinner at an Arab restaurant in Yafo.  It was tasty and it was great to catch up with the group about what everyone did over winter break.  We head back to the hotel and go to bed because we have a long day of walking tomorrow.</p>
