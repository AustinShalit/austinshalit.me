							<h2>Pre Departure</h2>
							<h6><i>January 2nd, 2019</i></h6>
							<p>The day has finally arrived for me to leave home and go to Israel to study. I spent my day finishing packing up some last minute supplies and clothing. This is also a special time because I will not be able to celebrate my 21st birthday at home with family and friends. We decide to go out to lunch at The Sherman. After finishing lunch, my family and I returned home to grab my suitcases and prepare to leave for LAX.</p>
							<p>This is the last time my family will be whole for almost six months. We have a family meeting and hug and say our goodbyes. At 3pm I start to get into the car. We leave for the airport at 3pm, even though my flight does not leave until 6pm because of the traffic that holiday travelers make. Once at the curb, I give my parents one final hug and prepare to board the plane to SFO.</p>

							<h2>Travel</h2>
							<h6><i>January 2nd & 3rd, 2019</i></h6>
							<p>The plane ride (UA481) to SFO was short and sweet. We were in the air for only 52 minutes. On landing I was able to see the Golden Gate bridge. On arrival in San Francisco, I made my way to the international terminal. I entered the secondary screening area for the flight to Israel and watched the new year's episode of Doctor Who. It was nice to see the Daleks making into the series.</p>
							<p>Once on the plane to Israel (UA954) I met my seat mate. She was traveling to Israel on business and we talked about some of the different places in Israel to go see. The Dreamliner is amazing. The huge windows really do make the flying experience much better because you do not feel as cramped. They also help because the flight attendants lock the windows to be closed when it is bright outside, helping people sleep. My favorite part is that people cannot close their windows giving me an unobstructed view of the landscape. We took an aggressively polar route to Israel, over the west coast of the US and then over Canada, Greenland, Sweden, Poland, and Turkey. We were in the air for 13 hours, 3 minutes and in that time I was able to watch the original Superman, BlacKkKlansman, and Crazy Rich Asians. All of the movies were good but BlacKkKlansman was my favorite. After landing, I found a cab and got to the hotel and went straight to bed after a long day of travel.</p>

							<h2>Arrival</h2>
							<h6><i>January 4th, 2019</i></h6>
							<p>I woke up really early just as the sun was coming out.  I am a bit tired but overall feel excited for the day.  I decide to get up and go for a walk along the beach front.  It is calm with the city still getting started with the day.  I get a bagel and lox from an Aroma with a beach front view.</p>
							<p>My advisor, Isa, calls just as I am finishing breakfast.  She asks me if I can run to the market to purchase fruits and pastries to snack on for the group while walking around tomorrow.  Of course, I agree and make my way over to the market.  The market is massive.  There must have been hundreds of shops and thousands of people there buying fresh fruits and vegetables, clothing, jewelry, and nick-nacks.  I buy what I can carry back to the hotel.  I would do this trip three more times to get enough food for the group.  It was nice to have something to do during the day.</p>
							<p>Once almost everyone arrives we go out for dinner at an Arab restaurant in Yafo.  It was tasty and it was great to catch up with the group about what everyone did over winter break.  We head back to the hotel and go to bed because we have a long day of walking tomorrow.</p>

							<h2>שבת בתל אביב-יפו</h2>
							<h6><i>January 5th, 2019</i></h6>
							<p>Even though it is shabbat, we are up early and on the move.  We are going to spend the day walking through Tel-Aviv Yafo, learning about Israel's history.  There are only a few people around and all of the shops are closed.  At the market we learn about the different kinds of houses and what they mean to the people who built them.  The next stop is Rothschild Boulevard where many new companies are located along with Dizengoff House.  One of the interesting things that our guide, shares is that in order to build a skyscraper in Tel Aviv, the builder must purchase and restore one of the original homes next to the plot of land where the building is to be built.  This gives Tel Aviv an interesting skyline with small little homes between each tall building.</p>
							<p>We continue to walk around and grab a bite to eat.  I have shawarma because I know that at Neot Smadar I will be without meat for a while.  We walk through a neighborhood going through a revitalization.  There is a lot of graffiti everywhere.  The one piece that stood out to me is one showing the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.  It came to my attention because it was the only piece that did not have other graffiti layered on it.  It was as if the community was respecting it and what it represents.</p>
							<p>After walking six miles around Tel Aviv, the group decides to walk another three miles (both ways) to the dock for dinner.  It was a long cold walk but it was nice to have some peace after a day in the city.</p>

						<h2>קיסריה ועכו</h2>
						<h6><i>January 6th, 2019</i></h6>
						<p>Another day of adventure-- this time in Caesarea.  We started by the amphitheater and made our way across the stadium.  It was very windy outside the sea was jumping over the barrier.  We then went to see the aqueduct but did not get a chance to leave the bus.  A little disappointing because I think is one of the most beautiful parts of Israel but I was ok with staying in the bus in the middle of the storm.</p>
						<p>After leaving Caesarea we headed north to Acre.  There we had lunch in the Arab market.  It was a little weird being in a place where I could not read the street signs.  More shawarma for lunch but this was probably the best shawarma, I've had.  We explored the old safe route for transporting money between the harbor and the bank.</p>

						<h2>To the desert</h2>
						<h6><i>January 7th, 2019</i></h6>
						<p>After getting out of bed and packing up we hop on the bus for the desert but first we have a stop to make.  As soon as we arrived, I knew exactly where we were.  It was a good thing that Isa did not share where we were going because if she had, I most certainly would have shared. We were at the Ayalon Institute, also known as the bullet museum.  The institute was an underground secret bullet factory that was in service before Israel was declared a state.  We went through the tour and got to see the laundry and the bakery.</p>
						<p>On the way to Neot Smadar we stopped for a quick lunch where I had shawarma for the last time before entering the kibbutz.</p>
						<p>When we arrived it was already dark so it was hard to see what was around.  It was very quiet though.  We got off the bus, said our goodbyes, and met Israela, the guest organizer at Neot Smadar.  She showed us to our home and left us to get unpacked.  We went to dinner.  It was a little strange.  The dinning room felt empty even though there was a good amount of people in there but I was too tired to care.  I ate my soup and then went home and went to bed.</p>

						<h2>נאות סמדר</h2>
						<h6><i>January 8th, 2019</i></h6>
						<p>I slept pretty well for being in a new unfamiliar place.  Breakfast was weird because it was so silent with so many people.  Luckily I was able to sit with my group-mates.  For breakfast it was a make your own salad bar and oatmeal.  I was a little disappointed that there were no scrambled eggs.  But the salad was awesome.  I think that I will get better at making salads while here.  I also need to learn the words in Hebrew for all of the fruits and vegetables we will be eating that way I can talk about them. After breakfast we went back home for meetings and seeing what materials we had related to the project.</p>
						<p>Less people were at lunch compared to breakfast.  After lunch we went for a hike around Neot Smadar to learn the area a bit. The desert is vast and desolate but yet beautiful.  The ground is like shards of broken glass.  It is interesting to walk on.  There is some green near where water rushes after each rainfall.</p>
